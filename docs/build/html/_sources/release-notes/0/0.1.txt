======================
 Percona Playback 0.1
======================
Initial public release. Just supports reading from slow query log and blasting queries at a database server. It should be considered Alpha quality.

Features:
 * slow query log parsing
 * mysql client library
 * one thread per client thread
 * basic report as to how the replay went
 * "as fast as possible" playback only. If query execution takes less time on playback server than original one, percona-playback will not pause.

Notable missing features:
 * wall-time playback: ability to have the same amount of real-world time pass (i.e. a gap of 10seconds between queries will be preserved).
 * parsing of general query log
